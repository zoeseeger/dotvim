#
#  Default .profile for bash/ksh/sh user of NF systems.  
#
#  Commands in this file are executed:
#  when a bash user first logs in
#
#  This file may alternatively be called $HOME/.bash_profile,
#  $HOME/.bash_login or $HOME/.profile - the first one of these
#  found is used.
#
#  The environment variables (and ulimits) set here will be 
#  inherited by subshells.  Use this file to set up your 
#  environment for an interactive session or a batch job.  
#  Most of the environment can be set using module commands.
#  Include commonly used module commands below but be wary of 
#  loading too many modules - you are likely to incur conflicts.
#  It is usually better to load the modules required by a bacth
#  in the batch script.
#
#  See http://nf.nci.org.au/facilities/software/modules.php
#  for instructions on how to set your environment to use specific
#  software packages.
#
#  Note that the .bashrc file is NOT executed at login time but 
#  instead every time a sh or bash script is run.

#  By default .bashrc file is NOT sourced at login time but is in
#  subshells.  Source here to pick up aliases etc.
